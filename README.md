## 📦 Project Structure (Lovable)

Since this project is built with **Lovable**, most of the application logic resides inside the Lovable platform:

- **Flows** – Handles AI processing logic.
- **Pages** – Visual layout & interaction design.
- **Blocks** – Components like maps, voice input, and AI responses.
- **Supabase Integration** – Configured via external connections for auth & database storage.

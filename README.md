# 🎤 Voice Map Muse

**Voice Map Muse** is a voice-powered AI web application built using [Lovable AI](https://www.lovable.app) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and backend services. This project demonstrates how natural language processing, AI-driven storytelling, and geographic context can work together to deliver immersive, interactive user experiences.

## 📦 Project Structure (Lovable)

Since this project is built with **Lovable**, most of the application logic resides inside the Lovable platform:

- **Flows** – Handles AI processing logic.
- **Pages** – Visual layout & interaction design.
- **Blocks** – Components like maps, voice input, and AI responses.
- **Supabase Integration** – Configured via external connections for auth & database storage.
